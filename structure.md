Here's how you could adjust the structure of your conference paper:

**1. Introduction**
   - Introduce the importance of addressing missing data in predictive modelling.
   - Highlight the significance of preserving relationships in the imputation process.
   - State the research objectives and the methods employed.

**2. Related Work**
   - Summarize existing research on missing data handling techniques, data imputation methods, and the importance of preserving relationships.
   - Emphasize the need for a comprehensive evaluation of imputation techniques.

**3. Experimental Setup**
   - Describe the dataset used for the experiments (source, size, attributes).
   - Explain the data preprocessing steps, including the identification of missing values.
   - Detail the choice of evaluation metrics: Preservation of Relationships, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Describe the process of dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.

**4. Data Imputation**
   - Explain the rationale behind the selected data imputation techniques (e.g., Mode, MICE, Hot Deck, KNN).
   - Detail the application of each imputation technique to the dataset.
   - Provide a clear description of how relationships were preserved during the imputation process.

**5. Evaluation Results and Analysis**
   - Present the results of models using imputed data.
   - Display the performance metrics (Preservation of Relationships, MAE, RMSE) obtained for each imputed model.
   - Analyze the performance improvements achieved through data imputation.
   - Discuss the implications of the findings for handling missing data in real-world applications.

**6. Limitations and Future Work**
   - Address the limitations of the study, particularly the absence of baseline models.
   - Discuss potential sources of bias and uncertainty related to data imputation.
   - Propose avenues for future research, such as exploring alternative imputation techniques or hybrid approaches.

**7. Conclusion**
   - Summarize the key findings and contributions of the study.
   - Reiterate the importance of preserving relationships in data imputation.
   - Reflect on the significance of the results for advancing predictive modelling in the presence of missing data.

**8. References**
   - Cite the sources referenced throughout the paper.

By focusing on the analysis of imputed models and discussing the implications, limitations, and potential future directions, you can still provide valuable insights and contribute to the understanding of handling missing data through imputation techniques.
