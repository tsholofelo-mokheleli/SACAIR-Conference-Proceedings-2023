Filling missing categorical data with a specific value, such as -1 to indicate "missing," can be a reasonable approach in some cases, but it's important to consider the implications and potential challenges before doing so.

Pros of Using -1 for Missing Values:

1. **Preserve Information:** By assigning a specific value like -1 to missing categorical data, you explicitly indicate that the value is missing, which can help preserve the information that a value was expected but not available.

2. **Differentiate from Valid Values:** -1 as a placeholder can help differentiate between genuine categorical values and missing values during analysis and model training.

Cons and Considerations:

1. **Potential Bias:** Introducing a new category (-1) can potentially introduce bias in your analysis or model, as the algorithm might interpret this as a distinct category and treat it differently from other categories. This might lead to unintended impacts on your results.

2. **Algorithm Sensitivity:** Some machine learning algorithms might be sensitive to the addition of a new category. For example, decision trees could branch on the -1 category and create an artificial split that might not generalize well.

3. **Data Distribution:** Depending on the frequency of missing values, the -1 category could become a dominant category in your dataset, affecting the distribution and potentially affecting the performance of your models.

4. **Interpretability:** Using -1 might affect the interpretability of your results, as it's not a natural category. Stakeholders and other researchers might find it less intuitive.

5. **Alternative Imputation:** Consider other imputation strategies, such as mode imputation (filling with the most frequent category), using predictive models to impute values, or even using more advanced methods like k-modes clustering.

In summary, using -1 to represent missing categorical data can be a valid strategy, but it's important to carefully assess the impact on your analysis and models. If you decide to proceed with this approach, be aware of the potential biases and challenges it might introduce, and ensure that it aligns with the goals and requirements of your analysis or project.
