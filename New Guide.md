Certainly, it's possible to ensemble data imputations in your machine learning experiment for your conference paper. Ensembling different imputation methods can often lead to more robust and accurate results, especially when dealing with missing data challenges.

Here's a high-level outline of how you can approach this:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Begin by cleaning and preparing your dataset.
   - Identify and handle missing data in your dataset.

2. **Imputation Methods:**
   - Implement three different imputation methods: Mode imputation, MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations), and KNN imputation.
   - Apply each of these methods to the missing data in your dataset.

3. **Model Building:**
   - After imputing the missing data using the three methods, split your dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Build machine learning models on each of the imputed datasets separately. You can choose different types of models such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or neural networks depending on the nature of your data and the problem you are addressing.

4. **Ensemble Imputations:**
   - Ensemble the results from the models trained on imputed datasets. There are several ways to do this:
     - **Voting:** You can let each model predict the target variable, and the final prediction can be the majority vote or average of these predictions.
     - **Stacking:** Train another machine learning model (meta-learner) on the predictions from individual models, using the true target variable as the label. This can often lead to improved performance.
     - **Weighted Averaging:** Assign different weights to the predictions of different imputed datasets based on their performance.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of your ensemble method using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve (AUC).
   - Compare the performance of the ensemble approach to the individual imputation methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of your proposed approach.

6. **Results and Conclusion:**
   - Present the results in your conference paper, highlighting the advantages of ensembling imputations in improving the prediction of mental disorders in the presence of missing data.

Remember to document your methodology thoroughly, including details about hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and any other relevant information. This will help your paper stand out and make it easier for others to replicate your experiment. Good luck with your research and conference paper!
