Thank you for providing more detailed performance metrics for each imputation method. Based on these metrics, we can make a more informed assessment of the imputation methods:

1. **Mode Imputation:**
   - **Accuracy**: It shows good accuracy for all classifiers.
   - **Precision**: Good precision scores across classifiers.
   - **Recall**: High recall values, indicating that it captures most of the positive instances.
   - **F1 Score**: Balanced F1 scores.
   - **Roc Auc**: Decent ROC AUC for most classifiers, except SVM.

2. **MICE Imputation:**
   - **Accuracy**: Slightly lower accuracy compared to Mode Imputation.
   - **Precision**: Generally good precision scores.
   - **Recall**: High recall values, similar to Mode Imputation.
   - **F1 Score**: Balanced F1 scores.
   - **Roc Auc**: ROC AUC values are slightly lower than Mode Imputation.

3. **Hot Deck Imputation:**
   - **Accuracy**: Competitive accuracy, especially for KNN.
   - **Precision**: Good precision scores.
   - **Recall**: High recall values.
   - **F1 Score**: Balanced F1 scores.
   - **Roc Auc**: Improved ROC AUC compared to Mode and MICE for some classifiers.

4. **K-NN Imputation:**
   - **Accuracy**: Generally good accuracy, comparable to Mode Imputation.
   - **Precision**: Good precision scores.
   - **Recall**: High recall values.
   - **F1 Score**: Balanced F1 scores.
   - **Roc Auc**: Similar ROC AUC values to Mode Imputation.

Considering these results, there is no single imputation method that is definitively the best for all classifiers and metrics. The choice of imputation method may depend on the specific performance metric you prioritize or the classifier you intend to use. Here are some considerations:

- **Accuracy**: Mode Imputation and K-NN Imputation perform well in terms of accuracy.
- **Precision**: Hot Deck Imputation consistently shows good precision scores across classifiers.
- **Recall**: Mode Imputation, MICE Imputation, and K-NN Imputation have high recall values.
- **F1 Score**: Most imputation methods have balanced F1 scores.
- **Roc Auc**: Mode Imputation and K-NN Imputation have relatively better ROC AUC scores.

To make a decision, you can consider the overall trade-offs between these metrics and choose the imputation method that aligns best with your specific objectives and the classifier you plan to use. Additionally, you may want to conduct further experimentation and possibly perform statistical tests to determine if the differences in performance are statistically significant.
